You will be creating a very simple application for serving files in local intranet by http/https protocol
As a language use python and appropriate framework for backed and frontedn. I prefer flask.
The application wil have frontend a backend API.
It will run in docker, preferably two separate containers (frontend/backend)
backend will use a volume to store data.
The application will show contents of the volume (directory listing)
It will allow to create folder, upload file, upload whole folder
There will be always specific URI for each file. When you use this uri, it will directly download the file.
the application will be served by gunicorn
in the third container, there will be nginx as a proxy to apps
orchestrate container by docker swarm
In the end add github actions pipeline to build containers push them in GHCR. Have only the latest version available for now.
